    &quot;A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea,
    called the topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: 
    a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one central,
    unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your&nbsp;broader&nbsp;argument&quot;
